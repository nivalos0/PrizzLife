  <strong>PrizzLife</strong> - Formerly the best and most used <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/155615604/Prison-Life">Prison Life</a> script with over 200+ commands, and multi-executor support. Please wait, this will not be updated, because a rewrite is coming soon.

## ℹ️ Information

This is a continued version of PrizzLife which has since been abandoned by the owner. This is **NOT** a full time project, and I am **NOT** responsible for kicks, or bans from Prison Life. The things below I do **NOT** plan to add:

- Any Loop Commands

- Commands that mention all, such as "kill all" etc.

- Crash, or Server Lag commands.

- Backdoors for Kick commands.

## 👥 Users

~~PrizzLife is executed around 5,000 times a day. We found this out by statistics. We no longer run these statistics.~~

- PrizzLife is no longer being executed every day, it's been **dead,** the whole goal of this Repository is to try and revive it.
